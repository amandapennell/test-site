    <h2>The Music</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Led Zeppelin&#39;s music was rooted in the blues.</strong>
      The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin&#39; Wolf.
      The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals.
      Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from Jansch Page adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing.
      The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually their music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song.
      After visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron-Yr-Aur">Bron-Yr-Aur</a> in <time datetime="1970">1970</time>, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band&#39;s chief lyricist.
      Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed.
      In the later stages of the band&#39;s career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard.
      Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Early lyrics drew on the band&#39;s blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs.
      Many of the band&#39;s songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love, and sexual conquest (common in rock, pop and blues music).
      Elements of mythology and mysticism were also incorporated into their music, especially on <em>Led Zeppelin III</em> and the untitled album referred to as <em>Led Zeppelin IV</em>. These themes largely grew out of Plant&#39;s interest in legends and history.
      However, these elements were often taken to reflect Page&#39;s interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages.
      Some of alleged messages were said to be contained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking">backmasking</a>; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to musicologist Robert Walser, &ldquo;Led Zeppelin&#39;s sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant&#39;s wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page&#39;s heavily distorted crunch&rdquo;.
      These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal. Part of this reputation depends on the band&#39;s use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like <em>Whole Lotta Love</em> and <em>Heartbreaker</em>.
      Riffs often contained melodic or rhythmic variations; as in <em>Black Dog</em>, where three different time signatures are used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Page&#39;s guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music.
      Plant&#39;s use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin&#39;s vocal technique.
      Bonham&#39;s drumming was noted for his power, his rapid rolls, and his fast beats on a single bass drum.
      Jones&#39; basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band&#39;s sound.
